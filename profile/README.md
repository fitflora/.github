# Project for Tsinghua University "Design Futures Shared Vision" Summer Programme 2024 - Attained 1st Place

### PROJECT THEME
FitFlora aims to help Beijing achieve food safety and security by cultivating horticultural and vertical farming practices, utilizing public spaces like parks across the state, and integrating advanced technologies from IoT to material science. 

### DESCRIPTION
FitFlora is a revolutionary project that transforms public parks into vibrant hubs of fitness, horticulture, and community engagement. By integrating advanced technologies like IoT sensors, digital twins, and precision horticulture into exercise equipment, FitFlora promotes sustainable food production while encouraging physical health and social interaction in urban spaces.

Designed for urban parks in Beijing, FitFlora addresses food security challenges by converting underutilized green spaces into productive agricultural hubs. It leverages community involvement and cutting-edge technology to create a model for sustainable urban living, aligning with key United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

### TECHNOLOGIES INVOLVED
1) IoT Arduino Sensors: Real-time monitoring of plant health and environmental conditions, enabling automated irrigation
2) Digital Twin Technology: Simulates optimal growth conditions and predicts plant health needs.
3) Mobile Application: Built in Java using Android Studio, integrated with Firebase for user data management and Google Maps for location-based services.
4) Sustainable Materials: Use of bamboo, recycled plastics, and innovative soil technologies to promote sustainable construction.
